Uh, uh
Kom zu mir, kom zu mir
You're the only one
Give me love, give me love
From dusk till dawn
Come to me, come to me
Boy we can get on
Give me love, give me love
From the dusk till dawn

Falling through the floor
Baby, this is devil’s door
Burning in the flame
Wanna know my secret?
Bang!
Boom… boom… boom…
Uh!
